Dependency-Check Jenkins Plugin
==============================

Dependency-Check is a utility that identifies project dependencies and checks if there are any known, publicly disclosed, vulnerabilities. This tool can be part of the solution to the OWASP Top 10 2013: A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities. This plug-in can independently execute a Dependency-Check analysis and visualize results.

[The Dependency-Check Jenkins Plugin][plugin-site]
 features the ability to perform a dependency analysis build and later view results post build. The plugin is built using [analysis-core] and features many of the same features that Jenkins static analysis plugins offer, including thresholds, charts and the ability to view vulnerability information should a dependency have one identified.

More information can be found on the [wiki], source code is available at [github].

Note, not all of the features in the HTML report produced by dependency-check, when viewed from within Jenkins, may not work correctly as [Jenkins set a restrictive CSP header](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Configuring+Content+Security+Policy). This does not affect the functionality of the tool or other reporting capabilities within the Jenkins plugin. Two options to re-enable the missing features in the HTML report would be to either download the report and view it locally or modify the CSP header to allow in-line script.
