# Telemetry

## Scarf

OWASP dependency-check uses [Scarf](https://about.scarf.sh/) to collect anonymous usage data to help us understand how the software is being used and how we can improve it. You can opt out of telemetry collection by setting the environment variable `SCARF_NO_ANALYTICS` or `DO_NOT_TRACK` to `true`.
